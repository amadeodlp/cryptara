# COSMOS

> _"The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our contemplations of the cosmos stir us ‚Äî there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a great height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries."_

3. **Cosmic Interface (Frontend)** - The observable universe through which users can navigate and interact with the entire COSMOS
